Hello! I am a third-year PhD student of Operations Research at Cornell Tech, where I am lucky to be advised by [Prof. Nikhil Garg](https://gargnikhil.com/). My research interest lies in the study of societal systems using mechanism design and data science/machine learning techniques, to improve their efficiency and promote equitable usage. Things I have worked on include [college admission](files/paper1.pdf) and [311 systems](files/paper2.pdf).



Previously, I obtained my BE in Industrial Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/) in 2020.
