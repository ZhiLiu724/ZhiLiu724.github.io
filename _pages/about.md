Hello! I am a third-year PhD student at Cornell Tech, where I am lucky to be advised by [Prof. Nikhil Garg](https://gargnikhil.com/). My research interest lies in the study of societal systems using mechanism design and data science/machine learning techniques, to improve their efficiency and promote equitable usage.
