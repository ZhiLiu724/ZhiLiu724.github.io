Hello! I am Zhi ([how to pronounce?](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/zh√¨)), a fifth-year PhD candidate of Operations Research at [Cornell Tech](https://www.tech.cornell.edu/), where I am lucky to be advised by Professor [Nikhil Garg](https://gargnikhil.com/). 



I am broadly interested in the interplay of data, policy, and societal systems: how are data generated, what can we learn from them, and how do we design practical policies to improve these systems. Things I have worked on during my PhD studies include [college admission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08922), [311 systems for reporting incidents in cities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08620), and [public library systems](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/30231). I am incredibly fortunate to have worked with the New York Public Library as part of the PiTech PhD Fellowship program during the Summer of 2023. During the Summer of 2024, I interned at Theorem LP, specializing in loan-level risk prediction and underwriting.



Previously, I obtained my BE in Industrial Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/) in 2020, with a Minor in Applied Statistics. During my undergrad, I worked on various things including application of network interdiction problem, scheduling in hospitals, and a numerical solver for PDEs.



Outside of office, I enjoy spending time in nature. If you are interested in the theory of optimization algorithms and mathematics of data science, check out some amazing work by my partner [Tao](https://taotolojiang.github.io/).
