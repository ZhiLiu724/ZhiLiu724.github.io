Hello! I am a third-year PhD student of Operations Research at [Cornell Tech](https://www.tech.cornell.edu/), where I am lucky to be advised by Professor [Nikhil Garg](https://gargnikhil.com/). 



My research interest lies in the study of societal systems using mechanism design and data science/machine learning techniques, in order to improve their efficiency and promote equitable usage. I am particularly fascinated by people's behavioral patterns in different settings and the means to understand them. Things I have worked on during my PhD studies include [college admission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08922) and [311 systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08620).



Previously, I obtained my BE in Industrial Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/) in 2020, with a Minor in Applied Statistics. During my undergrad, I worked on various things including application of network interdiction problem, scheduling in hospitals, and a numerical solver for PDEs.



Outside of office, you will most likely find me hiking, rock climbing/working out, or taking photos of the beautiful world around me.
